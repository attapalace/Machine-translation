# Machine-translation
Udacity NLP project for machine translation

In this notebook I built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

I made preprocessing for the data at first and then made different RNN Models using keras library.
